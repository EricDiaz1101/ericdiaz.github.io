On this webpage, I am going to talk about the skills that I have acquired from my here at NIU so far. 
After becoming an OM&IS major, I have learned a lot more about Microsoft Office. This includes excel, word,
powerpoint and access. I have also learned how to use SAP and SQL recently. Lastly, of course I have learned 
some HTML from this course. All of these skills will help me in the near future when it's time to find a job
after graduation.
