<p> Something that I learned in chapter 4 was how to add an image on the webpage.This was very useful because
    <br> it makes the webpage look a lot nicer.
</p>
<p>Another thing that I learned was how to style the text. The reason I styled my text is because making it a 
<br> specific color or bold or itallic will make it look cleaner.
