This section of my webpage is going to explain some vacations I have been on recently.
Last spring, I went on a cruise to the Bahamas with some of my buddies for spring break. 
We went for 4 nights and 5 days and docked at three different Islands. It was all inclusive
and one of the best trips I havhe ever been on!

                Another vacation that I've been on was to Miami, Florida. I went on this trip about a month ago for spring break
                with some of my friends and it was really fun! We stayed by South Beach and there was something to do
                at all times of the day. I would definately recommend either taking a trip to the Bahamas or Miami when 
                you can!
